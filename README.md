# API DATA COLLECTION PIPELINE
____


## Milestone 1

Firstly, we need to get our hands on some infrastructure similar to that which you'd find if you were a data engineer working at Pinterest. 

The files should contain a few things:

An API listening for events made by users on the app, or developer requests to the API
A user emulations script which simulates users uploading data to Pinterest.
